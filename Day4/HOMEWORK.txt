*******Typecasting

Typecasting means changing the data type of a variable to another datatype.
There are two type of type casting.
Implicit and explicit.

Implicit is a type casting which can be done automatically by the compiler.
Explicit is something which needs to be done forcefully by the programmer.

*******Closure

It is a feature of js which allows us to access outer function's scope from the inner function.
eg.

function myfunc()
{
    var a= 5;
    function display(){
        console.log(a)
    }
    display();
}
myfunc();

*******maps

Maps helps us to traverse through each element of an array

Things Learned

*About different variables:
var: used to declare variable
let: used to declare block scoped variable
const: used to declare a variable whose value cannot be initialized later.

*And Diffence between them.

Variables declared using var can be used throughout the function where they are declared.
While , variables declared by let are available only inside the block where they are declared. 

*About different type of loops and its uses:

For loop: used to iterate repeatedly a block of code till the condition is true.
forEach: It loops through any array provided function for each index of the array.
for of : loops over the iterable object
for in : loops over the properties of an array
