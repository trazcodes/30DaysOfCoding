*******Typecasting

Typecasting means changing the data type of a variable to another datatype.
There are two type of type casting.
Implicit and explicit.

Implicit is a type casting which can be done automatically by the compiler.
Explicit is something which needs to be done forcefully by the programmer.

*******Closure

It is a feature of js which allows us to access outer function's scope from the inner function.
eg.

function myfunc()
{
    var a= 5;
    function display(){
        console.log(a)
    }
    display();
}
myfunc();

*******maps

Maps helps us to traverse through the index of an array
